## 🎯 What’s the problem?

Before 2020, **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** dominated AI-generated images.  
But GANs had serious issues:
- ❌ Unstable training  
- ❌ Mode collapse (same few images)  
- ❌ Hard to evaluate likelihood  

So UC Berkeley researchers asked:
> “Can we generate images not by *fighting* like GANs, but by *calmly reversing noise*?”

That idea gave birth to **Diffusion Models** — elegant, stable, and surprisingly powerful.

## 🌫 Step 1 — The Idea: Add Noise, Then Remove It

Imagine you have a clear photo of a cat 🐱.  
Each second, you sprinkle a little Gaussian noise.  
After 1000 steps, it turns into pure static.  

That’s the **forward process**.

Now, train a neural network to **reverse** that process —  
to *denoise* step by step until you get the original image back.  
That’s the **reverse process**.

> The goal: learn to “undo” noise, one tiny step at a time.

## 🧠 Step 2 — How It Works

The DDPM model consists of two directions:

| Process | Description | Direction |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Forward (Diffusion)** | Adds Gaussian noise to data | Data → Noise |
| **Reverse (Generation)** | Removes noise using a neural network | Noise → Data |

During training, the model learns to **predict the noise** that was added, not the image itself.  
This clever trick — called **ε-prediction** — makes training simple and stable.

```python
# Simplified training loop
for x0 in dataset:
    t = random_timestep()
    noise = torch.randn_like(x0)
    xt = add_noise(x0, noise, t)
    predicted_noise = model(xt, t)
    loss = MSE(noise, predicted_noise)
